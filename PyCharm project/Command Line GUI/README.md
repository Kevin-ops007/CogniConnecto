## Edit menu and Settings
```
A developer can edit the menu to display only the commands that they need, adding new commands isn't hard too, a config.json file is usedto add a command and the command behavior can be added using a script file for iterm

Settings is to help user to set the default paths to run commands on their machines's directory. We support local and remote machine default paths. 
```

## Future scope
```
Add more commands spefic to each team and their usages. Add more tenants and users. Add the ability to access Office. The menu can also be extended to keep track of commands in use, such as track if vserver run has started, finished or if finished sucessfully.
